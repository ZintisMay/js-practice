# js-practice

This assignment is to go through the "arrayPractice" file and write code so that it presents you with the correct data.
Unlike the previous homework, since this one is more complicated there aren't checks for correctness (such as two matching numbers and strings). You'll have to figure out if you are correct, and we'll go over it all in a future lesson.

To do this assignment, you will be writing code in arrayPractice.js, and using dummyPersons.js as a reference.

You'll run the code using the command line:

  node arrayPractice.js

You can use the command line in vsCode. Although if you prefer bash or windows powershell, that's fine too.

Your goal is to complete each question, usually using at least array.map, array.filter, and array.reduce to help you get there.

Some problems require more than just those, so be wary. 

You should not need to write any for or while loops.

NOTE:

Some problems require you to have completed a previous problem. Keep that in mind.
